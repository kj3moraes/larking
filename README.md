An experiment with Rust, Webassembly and genetic algorithms.

## Building

## Why ?

This and [rusticade](https://github.com/kj3moraes/rusticade) were made as part of my journey learning Rust. Patryk27 has an [amazing series of posts](https://pwy.io/posts/learning-to-fly-pt1) describing the mathematics and the implementation of genetic algorithms. Highly recommned!

## Future Steps

I plan to add another species (maybe a predator) to see how they coevolve. I might add more traits like speed, size, sight, etc and let the user experiment with those too.
